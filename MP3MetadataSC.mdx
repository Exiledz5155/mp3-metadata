# Overview

MP3 Metadata is a project that aims to create a web-based version of common third party MP3 tagging applications.
Many first and third party metadata editors are clunky, buggy and/or not visually appealing.
Our goal with MP3 Metadata is to provide a platform for music enthusiasts who wish to customize their audio files, focusing on an appealing design and intuitive user experience.
