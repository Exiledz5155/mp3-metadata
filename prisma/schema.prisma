//Error: P1001: Can't reach database server at `mp3mysql.database.windows.net`:`1433` = add yourself to azure firewall

//commands for changing schema
//npx prisma generate     run this after making changes to the schema. this basically complies it
//npx prisma migrate dev --name your_migration_name      this applies the changes in development. kind of like git commit
//npx prisma migrate deploy     this deploys the changes

//may also need to cd into azure-functions and run "npx prisma generate --schema=../prisma/schema.prisma" however havent figured out if this is necessary

//use "npx prisma studio" to open db in browser
